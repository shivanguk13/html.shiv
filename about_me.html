<h1>ABOUT ME</h1>
<P>First, let me share some basic information about myself. 
    My name is Shivang Jagwan, and I hail from Agustyamuni. 
    I completed my 12th grade education from Kendriya Vidyalaya Agustyamuni, 
    and I also completed my 10th grade from the same school. My aspiration is to become a software engineer,
    which is why I am currently pursuing my bachelor's degree in Computer Science Engineering (CSE) from  <a href="./graphic_Era.html">Graphic Era University</a>.
